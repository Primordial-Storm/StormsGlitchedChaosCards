# StormsGlitchedChaosCards
This a WIP mod for rounds.

Currently trying to fix the following error when trying to launch game:

[Warning: Unity Log] ClassHanlder StormsGlitchedChaosCards.Cards.StormCards.SeedofaStormClass Init function is taking a long time to finish, this could be a bug.
[Error  : Unity Log] ClassHanlder StormsGlitchedChaosCards.Cards.StormCards.SeedofaStormClass Init function has Faild, Skipping. This will cause unintended game play behavoir.
[Info   : Unity Log] CMR=>Class Setup Complete

- Class cards appear despite the fact they shouldn't --> caused by class not loading properly --> fix: I have no bloody idea how or why
